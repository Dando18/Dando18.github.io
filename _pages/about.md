I am an undergraduate in Computer Science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 

My main interest is research in high performance and distributed deep learning, specifically regarding parallel algorithms, high performance linear algebra, large-batch convergence, and communication patterns. I am also interested in most HPC related areas from systems to numerical algorithms.

A large research project I've worked on is [MagmaDNN](https://github.com/MagmaDNN/magmadnn) with the [Innovative Computing Laboratory](https://www.icl.utk.edu/) and the [Joint Institute for Computer Science](https://www.jics.utk.edu/). I authored the library, which aims to implement high performance deep learning techniques. It has shown promising speed and continues to grow in functionality and performance.
