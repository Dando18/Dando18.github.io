Beginning Summer 2020 I will be a Computer Science PhD student at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/). I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in Spring 2020.

My main interest is research in high performance and distributed deep learning, specifically regarding parallel algorithms, high performance linear algebra, large-batch convergence, and communication patterns. I am also interested in most HPC related areas from systems to numerical algorithms.

A large research project I've worked on is [MagmaDNN](https://github.com/MagmaDNN/magmadnn) as a research assistant with the [Innovative Computing Laboratory](https://www.icl.utk.edu/) and the [Joint Institute for Computer Science](https://www.jics.utk.edu/). I authored the deep learning library, which aims to implement state-of-the-art high performance techniques in deep learning. It has shown promising speed and continues to grow in functionality and performance.

I also enjoy film, reading, and twizzlers of which I [sometimes write about](/year-archive/).

S'io credesse che mia risposta fosse<br>
A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,<br>
Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.<br>
Ma penciocche gammai di questo fondo<br>
Non torno viva alcun, s'i'odo il vero,<br>
Senza tema d'infamia ti rispondo_<br>
