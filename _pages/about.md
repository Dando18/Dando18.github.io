I am the [Sidney Fernbach Postdoctoral
Fellow](https://computing.llnl.gov/fernbach) at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory. I previously completed my PhD in computer science at the University
of Maryland, College Park working with the [Parallel Software and Systems
Group](https://pssg.cs.umd.edu). Before UMD, I completed my B.S. in Computer
Science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in Spring 2020 working with
the [Innovative Computing Laboratory](https://www.icl.utk.edu/) and the [Joint
Institute for Computer Science](https://www.jics.utk.edu/). I am also the
recipient of the [2024 ACM-IEEE CS George Michael Memorial HPC
Fellowship](https://awards.acm.org/hpc-fellows).

My research broadly centers around the intersection of systems and machine
learning where I utilize historical data to improve performance on HPC systems.
More recently I have branched into exploring how LLMs can be utilized to improve
scientific and high performance software development. You can check out our
HPC-Coder model [on
HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/hpcgroup/hpc-coder-v2-6.7b). Previously I
worked on high performance and parallel deep learning and authored the DL
framework [MagmaDNN](https://github.com/MagmaDNN/magmadnn).

Outside of work I also enjoy film,
[reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101631777-daniel-nichols), and
twizzlers (my _raison d'Ãªtre_) of which I [sometimes write
about](/year-archive/). I am also fairly active on the [Math StackExchange math
forum](https://math.stackexchange.com/users/274085/dando18). I currently reside
in Berkeley, California with [my lovely
wife](https://sites.google.com/view/mollyharnish/about).

S'io credesse che mia risposta fosse<br>
A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,<br>
Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.<br>
Ma penciocche gammai di questo fondo<br>
Non torno viva alcun, s'i'odo il vero,<br>
Senza tema d'infamia ti rispondo<br>
