I am a Computer Science PhD candidate at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) working with the [Parallel Software and Systems Group](https://pssg.cs.umd.edu). Before UMD, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](http://www.eecs.utk.edu/) in Spring 2020 working with the [Innovative Computing Laboratory](https://www.icl.utk.edu/) and the [Joint Institute for Computer Science](https://www.jics.utk.edu/).

My research interests are in high performance computing where I am currently working on large scale data analytics and machine learning to predict performance variations on supercomputers. Previously I worked on high performance and parallel deep learning and authored the DL framework [MagmaDNN](https://github.com/MagmaDNN/magmadnn).

Outside of work I also enjoy film, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101631777-daniel-nichols), and twizzlers (my _raison d'Ãªtre_) of which I [sometimes write about](/year-archive/). I am also fairly active on the [Math StackExchange math forum](https://math.stackexchange.com/users/274085/dando18).

S'io credesse che mia risposta fosse<br>
A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,<br>
Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.<br>
Ma penciocche gammai di questo fondo<br>
Non torno viva alcun, s'i'odo il vero,<br>
Senza tema d'infamia ti rispondo<br>
