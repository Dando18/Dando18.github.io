I am an undergraduate in Computer Science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 

My main interest is research in high performance and distributed deep learning, specifically regarded parallel algorithms, high performance linear algebra, large-batch convergence, and communication patterns.

A large project I've worked on is [MagmaDNN](https://github.com/MagmaDNN/magmadnn). I authored the library, which aims to implement high performance deep learning techniques. It's far from perfect and, as of yet, lacks a large support base, but it has shown promising speed and continues to grow.
