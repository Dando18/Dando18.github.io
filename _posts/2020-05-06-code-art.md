A fun hobby of mine is trying to create art with code. I particularly appreciate techniques, which expose structure unexpectedly. One particular method I enjoy is writing point-wise functions for color channels, i.e. writing functions for Red, Green, and Blue, which each take pixel coordinates and return the channel value for that pixel. With this method one can translate a seemingly point-wise generation method into beautiful structures unlike their generation.

I made [this website here](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~dnicho22/CodeArt), which allows custom code art generation in your browser. It's what I use to generate all the below samples. Check out the _Presets_ selection to see some already made art.

The easiest and most simple example is a color gradient. We can linearly interpolate each color channel from edge to edge. For instance,

```javascript
red(i, j, width, height) {
  return 255 * (height - i)/height;
}
green(i, j, width, height) {
  return 255 * (width - j)/width;
}
blue(i, j, width, height) {
  return 255 * j/width;
}
```

This gives use the nice color gradient shown below.

While seemingly complex, the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) maps quite nicely to this process. The Mandelbrot Set is centered around a complex series $$ z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c $$, where $$ z,c \in \mathbb{C} $$. Given a complex number $$ c $$ and $$ z_0 = 0 $$, if $$ z_n $$ remains bounded as $$ n $$ tends towards infinity, then $$ c $$ is in the Mandelbrot Set. If $$ z_n $$ diverges towards infinity, then $$ c $$ is not in the Mandelbrot Set.

Since complex numbers are coordinates in a 2D plane, this maps exceedingly well to our pixel generation method. For any given pixel $$ (row, column) $$, if $$ c = row + i\cdot column $$ remains bounded, then draw black. Otherwise draw white at that pixel. This gives a nice rendering of the Mandelbrot Set. We can also use the number of iterations it took to diverge to determine how to shade the pixel color.

```javascript
red(i, j, width, height) {
  let x0 = (j / width) * 3 - 2;
  let y0 = ((height-i) / height) * 2.0 - 1.0;
  let x = 0, y = 0, iter = 0, max_iter = 100;

  while (x*x + y*y <= 4 && iter < max_iter) {
    let tmp = x*x - y*y + x0;
    y = 2*x*y + y0;
    x = tmp;
    iter += 1;
  }

  let scaled_color = Math.pow((iter / max_iter), 0.25) * 255;
  return scaled_color;
}
green(i, j, width, height) {
  let x0 = (j / width) * 3 - 2;
  let y0 = ((height-i) / height) * 2.0 - 1.0;
  let x = 0, y = 0, iter = 0, max_iter = 100;

  while (x*x + y*y <= 4 && iter < max_iter) {
    let tmp = x*x - y*y + x0;
    y = 2*x*y + y0;
    x = tmp;
    iter += 1;
  }

  let scaled_color = Math.pow((iter / max_iter), 0.25) * 255;
  return scaled_color;
}
blue(i, j, width, height) {
  return 255;
}
```

This code gives us the following rendering:

However, we can use Hue, Saturation, Value (HSV) color channels to color the image for more color. We can also zoom on different sections of the set to get pretty renderings (inspired by [this post](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/35739/56964)).
