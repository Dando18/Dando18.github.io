Part 4 in a collection of posts where I'll give some of my thoughts and analysis on essays, short stories, novels, movies, etc. It is not really anything academic, but purely for me to practice my writing.

Fracture
------------------------------
A motion picture directed by Gregory Hoblit


Fracture, a glib mystery thriller, pits the criminal mastermind Ted Crawford, played by villainous Anthony Hopkins, against a young, guileful lawyer Willy Beachum played by a youthful Ryan Gosling. Little is offered in the area of strong female roles and the women characters are void of anything surpassing a "pretty face". Gosling's love interest, the hopeful mentor and private lawyer, lacks emotion and is arguably superfluous. The other potential female role is reticent, quite literally, for a large portion of the film. Any remnant of an inadequate cast is smothered by the captivating story. 

Provoked by his wife's clandestine affair, Ted, the airplane designer and reserved genius type, seeks out the ultimate revenge. His revenge is not typical, however, as he pursues retribution without consequence. Yes, he commits the "perfect" crime, if such a thing is possible. Amidst confrontation, he kills his wife, hands the murder weapon to a police officer, and signs a confession. Yet, this is the brilliance of the plan.

His seemingly imminent conviction is only legal bait to draw out the hot-shot, over-eager state prosecutor Willy. Which leads into the thrilling trial and meaty portion of the film.
