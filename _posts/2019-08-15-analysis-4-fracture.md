Part 4 in a collection of posts where I'll give some of my thoughts and analysis on essays, short stories, novels, movies, etc. It is not really anything academic, but purely for me to practice my writing.

Fracture
------------------------------
A motion picture directed by Gregory Hoblit


Fracture, a glib mystery thriller, faces the criminal mastermind Ted Crawford, played by villainous Anthony Hopkins, against a young, guileful lawyer Willy Beachum played by a youthful Ryan Gosling. Little is offered in the area of strong female roles and the cast is void of anything surpassing a "pretty face". Gosling's love interest, the hopeful private lawyer mentor, lacks emotion and is arguably superfluous to the plot. The other potential female role is reticent, quite literally, for a large portion of the film. 

Any remnant of an inadequate cast is smothered by the captivating story. Provoked by his wife's clandestine affair, Ted, the airplane designer and reserved genius type, seeks out the ultimate revenge. His revenge is not typical, however, as he seeks retribution without consequences.
