After enjoying the incredible season 2 finale of _The Mandalorian_ I was inspired to represent baby yoda in his truest form: _mathematical_.

If you are a sane human and have no idea how these<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> parametric equations<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> are baby yoda, then here is their wonderful plot:

<br />
And in the sake of the Christmas spirit here is another.

<div style="overflow-y: scroll; max-height: 400px">
<img src="{{ base_path }}/images/baby_yoda_standing_curve_eqn.png" alt="Baby Yoda Equations Image Not Available">
</div>

<br />
which looks like:

### Footnotes

<span id="f1">1</span> <span style="font-size:8pt;">I had quite a difficult time getting the equation to display directly in the browser and even $$\LaTeX$$ for that matter, hence, I put the ginormous image file in the middle of the page. So here are the equation's `.tex` files for the [first](/files/baby_yoda_face_curve_eqn.tex) and [second](/files/baby_yoda_standing_curve_eqn.tex) equations if for some odd reason you want them.</span> [↩](#a1)

<span id="f2">2</span> <span style="font-size:8pt;">In both of the above set of parametric equations we have $$0\le t \le 36\pi$$ and $$\theta(\cdot)$$ is the [Heaviside step function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heaviside_step_function)</span> [↩](#a2)
