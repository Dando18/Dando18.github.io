Experimenting with cocktails and the myriads of flavors and presentations
can be a delightful culinary avocation.
However, stocking a bar is expensive.
Different mixing alcohols typically range from 10-50 USD and you also need a 
swarm of other syrups, garnishes, and toppers.
Even with a reasonable selection of bottles one can still find themselves with
a lackluster number of cocktails that they can make.
After going through this morose experience myself I began to wonder what an
ideal set of cocktail ingredients would be.
As it turns out this problem can be solved (sort of) with some 
_old fashioned_ computer science.


## Finding the Right Ingredients

So how do we go about finding an optimally stocked bar?
First, we need to define what optimal is.
But before I lay out the objective, let us define a couple of terms.
Let $$ R $$ and $$ I $$ be the set of 
all recipes and ingredients, respectively. We will say a set of ingredients
$$ A \subseteq I $$ _satisfies_ a recipe $$ r \in R $$ if $$ r $$ can be made
using the ingredients in $$ A $$.

The most interesting problem (at least to me) is given a positive
integer $$ k $$ can we find the set of ingredients of size at most $$ k $$
that satisfy the largest number of recipes.
I.e. if we are only allowed $$ k $$ ingredients, how do we select these 
ingredients such that we can make the most recipes with them.
This can be notated as:

$$ \argmax_{A\subseteq I,\lvert A\rvert \le k}\,\sum_{r \in R} \mathbb{1}_{\{A\ \textrm{satisfies}\ r\}} $$

Here $$ \mathbb{1}_{\{A\ \textrm{satisfies}\ r\}} $$ is an indicator function 
that is $$ 1 $$ when the ingredients $$ A $$ satisfies the recipes $$ r $$ and
$$ 0 $$ otherwise. 

### A Brute-Force Solution

A more algorithmic friendly way to write our problem
is by considering the related problem of what recipes ___do not___ need
a list of ingredients. In this sense let $$ R_i \subseteq R $$ be
the set of recipes that do not use ingredient $$i\in I$$. The intersection of
these sets, for instance $$R_i \cap R_j \cap R_k$$, represents the set of all 
recipes that do not use ingredients $$i, j,$$ and $$k$$. Now finding the largest
intersection of at most $$\lvert I \rvert - k$$ of these subsets will give
the largest set of recipes that can be made with $$k$$ ingredients.
The brute-force algorithm for this can be expressed rather simply.


```python
# create list of subsets R_i for each ingredient i; R_i is all recipes that can be made without i 
subsets = set(frozenset(r for r in recipes if not r.uses_ingredient(i)) for i in all_ingredients)

max_subsets = max(combinations(subsets, len(subsets)-k), key=lambda s: len(frozenset.intersection(*s)))
```

This algorithm is equivalent to the minimum $$k$$-union problem and has been
proven to be NP-Hard [[1](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-note-on-the-hardness-of-the-k-ambiguity-problem-Vinterbo/98b601e213499d9810ce3abe3106fc7940e1ad0d)].
In the worst case it will iterate over 
$$\binom{\lvert I\rvert}{\lvert I\rvert-k}$$ combinations of sets and compute 
their intersection size. 
While the number of recipes $$\lvert R\rvert$$ impacts the duration to compute
the set intersections, this complexity is largely dominated by the 
$$\lvert I\rvert !$$ factorial term. Thus, it is necessary to keep this term 
small so that the brute-force algorithm can finish in a reasonable amount of 
time. Fortunately, the number of unique ingredients likely lies between 20 and 
100 for a reasonable list of recipes making it easy to keep small.
We also benefit from the fact that this algorithm is likely being run 
with very small values of $$ k $$ as that is of most interest.


We can further reduce the number of ingredients, $$\lvert I \rvert$$, with a 
couple of data set augmentations.
First, we can remove unnecessary ingredients from recipes. This includes any
items we are likely to already possess, such as ice, water, salt, sugar, etc. 
We can also remove garnishes from the recipes if we just care about the main 
drink. Additionally, we can make substitutes where applicable so as to reduce 
the total number of unique ingredients. For example, we may replace instances of 
_Rye Whiskey_ or _Bourbon_ with just _Whiskey_.
These three optimizations can meaningfully reduce the total search space for 
the brute-force algorithm.

## Other Algorithms
Using the reduced ingredients set from the brute-force algorithm I have also 
implemented several other algorithms and heuristics for comparison. 
These are detailed below.

### k Most Common Ingredients
Here we compute the number of occurrences of each ingredient across all recipes
and take the $$k$$ most common.
This could potentially yield the optimal solution or the worst case of 0
total recipes.
It has the benefit of a good time complexity: counting is $$O(\lvert I\rvert)$$
and finding the $$k$$ most common is $$O(\lvert I\rvert\log k)$$ with a 
heap queue. For a small fixed $$k$$ this is linear in $$\lvert I\rvert$$.

### Max Recipe Degree
Construct a graph $$\mathcal{G}_R=(V,E)$$ where $$V=R$$ and $$(r_i, r_j)\in E$$
iff $$r_i$$ and $$r_j$$ share an ingredient. Also constructed a weighted version
of $$\mathcal{G}_R$$ where $$w_{r_i,r_j}$$ is equal to the number of shared 
ingredients between $$r_i$$ and $$r_j$$.

Now select the max degree vertex $$v^* = \max_{v\in V}\deg v$$ and remove it
from the graph.
Update a set with the ingredients of $$v^*$$.
Continue this process until the set being built has size $$\ge k$$ or the 
graph is empty.
Select the built set as the final list of ingredients.

The time complexity is dominated by the graph construction which is 
roughly $$O(\lvert R\rvert^2)$$.

### Max Ingredient Degree
Similar to above construct a graph $$\mathcal{G}_I=(V,E)$$ where $$V=I$$ and
$$(i_m, i_n)\in E$$ iff $$i_m$$ and $$i_n$$ are in a recipe together.
The weight of the edge $$w_{i_m,i_n}$$ is the total number of recipes that
have both $$i_m$$ and $$i_n$$.

Select and remove the highest degree vertex $$v^*=\max_{v\in V}\deg v$$.
Do this $$k$$ times or until the graph is empty.
The $$k$$ removed vertices are the final selected set of ingredients.

### Greedy
Instead of fixing the ingredients this algorithm fixes the number of recipes to
$$k$$ and tries to find the smallest number of ingredients that satisfy at 
least $$k$$ recipes.

Let $$A=\{\}$$ be an empty set of recipes.
Pick a recipe $$r^*\in R$$ thats ingredients minimize the union of $$A$$ and 
the ingredients of $$r^*$$, i.e. $$r^* = \min_{r\in R}\lvert A \cup r\rvert$$.
Remove $$r^*$$ from $$R$$ and update $$A$$ such that $$A=A\cup r^*$$.
Repeat this process $$k$$ times.

This guarantees that the ingredients in $$A$$ satisfy at least $$k$$ recipes.
At each step we take the locally optimal solution making this a greedy
algorithm.
We end up computing $$O(k\lvert R\rvert)$$ unions making this a fairly fast
heuristic algorithm.

### Random Sampling
This is just to serve as a benchmark.
We take $$M$$ random subsets of size $$k$$ from $$I$$. 
The one that satisfies the most recipes is selected.

When testing I use an alternate method where I continue sampling until a
certain duration has passed (1 second).
Once that duration has passed the best subset found during sampling is selected.


## Results
I implemented all of the above in Python to compare their results and runtimes.
This code can be found [here](https://github.com/Dando18/cocktail-ingredients).
For input I used a hand-compiled set of 25 cocktail recipes found from
various internet sites.
Before running the algorithms the garnishes are filtered out and substitutions
for common ingredients are made as described in the brute-force algorithm.

It should be noted that the brute-force _exhaustive_ algorithm was only run
up to $$k=10$$ due to time limits. Additionally, due to the use of sets and
Python 3's non-deterministic hash functions the final list of ingredients found
by each algorithm is non-deterministic (however, its size is).

The first figure, depicted below, shows the number of recipes satisfied 
($$y$$-axis) by the returned list of ingredients ($$x$$-axis). 
Each line represents a different algorithm.

We see that _greedy_ performs very near the brute-force solution (___note:___ 
exhaustive cuts off after $$k=10$$ due to time limits).
The rest all perform similarly with result sizes about 3-4 lower than the
optimal.

Furthermore, the next figure highlights the runtime of each algorithm.
Note the $$y$$-axis is log scale 10.
As expected we see an exponential blow up in runtime for the brute-force
solution.
This algorithm, while exact, is infeasible for realistically sized data sets.
Combined with the above results we can conclude that the _greedy_ algorithm
is the best in terms of result to performance trade-off.

## The Best Ingredients
The numbers are indeed interesting, but what is the best subset of ingredients?
This what we initially set out for after all.
Running the brute-force algorithm with $$k=10$$ on 
[my small recipe data set](https://github.com/Dando18/cocktail-ingredients/blob/main/cocktails.json)
we get the following list of ingredients.

```
Cola, Cream, Lemon Juice, Vermouth, Gin, Campari, Whiskey, Beer, Tonic, Bitters
```

These, plus common household ingredients and garnishes, can be used to make
the following 11 recipes. 

```
Negroni, Hot Toddy, Jack and Coke, Boulevardier, Dry Martini, Gin Tonic, 
Boilermaker, Manhattan, Old Fashioned, Irish Coffee, Whiskey Neat
```

Note that these results are severely impacted by the data set used.
For example I could artificially inflate the result by adding recipes to my 
list that are just combinations of these 10 ingredients.
Thus, the scale of these numbers, 10 ingredients and 11 recipes, is not as 
interesting, but rather their optimality for this particular $$R$$ and $$I$$.
In this case, since we used the brute-force algorithm, we can conclude that
this is the optimal solution for our particular list of recipes.

For $$k=5$$ the brute force algorithm gives the following.

```
Ingredients: Gin, Vermouth, Whiskey, Campari, Bitters
Recipes: Old Fashioned, Dry Martini, Boulevardier, Negroni, Whiskey Neat, Manhattan
```

For larger $$\lvert I\rvert$$ and/or $$k$$ we will need to switch to the 
greedy heuristic algorithm.
However, we have previously demonstrated that this algorithm is a good 
candidate for finding good ingredient sets.
