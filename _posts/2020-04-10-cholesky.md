Cholesky decomposition is the factorization of a positive-definite, Hermitian matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. It is useful in numerous applications including solving linear systems, optimization, and monte-carlo simulations.

## Formulation
The formulation of a Cholesky decomposition is fairly straight-forward. Let $$A$$ be a [positive-definite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness_of_a_matrix), [Hermitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_matrix) matrix. Then

$$ A = LL^* $$

is the Cholesky decomposition, where $$L$$ is lower-triangular and $$L^*$$ is the [conjugate transpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_transpose) of $$L$$.

If $$A$$ is in fact positive-definite, then $$L$$ is unique.

## Algorithm
There are two main forms of the algorithm:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
a & b \cr
c & d 
\end{bmatrix}$$
